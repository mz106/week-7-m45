// //tells express that any function starting app. is using the express library

// app.use("/books", express.static("books"));
// //This tells express that if a user choose an endpoint of /books on the end of the server address then to run a web static server with the index.html file located in the "books" folder.

// app.listen(5001, () => console.log("Server listening on port 5001"));
// // app.listen runs the listen method from express. The listen method takes in a TCP/IP port, in this case 5001 and then runs an initial function. In this case the initial function is just a message to say that express is listening on port 5001. When listening express can react to any requests that come in on port 5001.
